FileZilla is decent, but doesn't really seem to care about keeping your details secure, so everything is saved in plaintext - hosts, ports, usernames, passwords, and so forth.

The following paths contain connection details:
- "%appdata%/Roaming/FileZilla/filezilla.xml"
- "%appdata%/Roaming/FileZilla/recentservers.xml"
